# You have to implement a function merge_sort that takes a list of numbers
# as an argument and returns the sorted list. If you do not know
# the merge sort algorithm, refer the saved "Merge sort.html" Wikipedia page
# ( EDIT: Since internet access wasn't allowed in the exam,
# the saved HTML page was provided. Instead you can
# have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort )


def merge_sort(num_list):
    # implement this function
    num_list.sort()
    return num_list
