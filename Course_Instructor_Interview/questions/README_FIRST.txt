1) There are 4 questions to solve. You can use either Python 2 or Python 3 to write your programs
2) You can use the test .py files (if present) to help you program according to the requirements.
   This is done using the unittest module. You can modify the code to add your own tests.
3) Code quality matters, the algorithm you use and the way you structure your code is important
4) When you finish, copy your files to the pen drive being passed around
5) And lastly, have fun and all the best!
