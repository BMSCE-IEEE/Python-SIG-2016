On August 6th, 2016, BMSCE IEEE organized a selection process to find Course Instructors
for the next Python Special Interest Group.

This folder contains all the questions and test files asked in the test.
The other folders of Course_Instructor_Interview contain solutions.


Here are the instructions from README_FIRST.txt


1) There are 4 questions to solve. You can use either Python 2 or Python 3 to write your programs
2) You can use the test .py files (if present) to help you program according to the requirements.
   This is done using the unittest module. You can modify the code to add your own tests.
3) Code quality matters, the algorithm you use and the way you structure your code is important
4) When you finish, copy your files to the pen drive being passed around
5) And lastly, have fun and all the best!
