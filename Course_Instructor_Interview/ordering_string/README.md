# Question
The program prompts for two inputs - Input String and Ordered String.

The program removes all digits and special characters from the Input String and checks if all the characters in Ordered String are present in Input String in the order they appear in Ordered String

You have to implement is_ordered_substring() function in order.py
You have to use test_order.py (made with the unittest module) to test your code.
