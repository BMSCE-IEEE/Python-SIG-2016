# Your task is to create a password generator.
# First your password generator should ask the length of the password in characters.
# Then it should ask the number of passwords to generate.
# (Note that we may check large numbers like 100 to see if they are consistent and don't repeat)
# Should have an option to include uppercase alphabets or only use lowercase.
# Should have an option to include numbers or not.
# Should have an option to include non-alphanumeric symbols (like:"?!@#$") or not.
# Note that the password generated should be random and not form dictionary words.
# (HINT: Use the random module, check help(random))

# Bonus points: Making the password generator as user friendly as possible.

# Some suggestions: warns users when the password length is too short,
#                   generates passwords that are easy to remember but still secure (HINT: use words.txt)
#                   gives the passwords a strong / weak rating eg. from 1 to 5

def generate_password(length, number, include_caps_bool, include_num_bool, include_sym_bool):
    # implement this function
    pass
