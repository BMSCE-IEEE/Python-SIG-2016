# Question

Your task is to create a password generator.
First your password generator should ask the length of the password in characters.
Then it should ask the number of passwords to generate.
Should have an options to:
* include uppercase alphabets or only use lowercase.
* include numbers or not.
* include non-alphanumeric symbols (like:"?!@#$") or not.

Note that the password generated should be random and not form dictionary words.
