# Python SIG 2016

Python 3 code used to teach a Python SIG (Special Interest Group) in the year 2016 in BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.
It was organized with the help of the local IEEE chapter, [BMSCE IEEE](http://bmsceieee.com/).

The SIG is an initiative by BMSCE IEEE that attempts to get students from BMS together
to learn a particular subject (in this case, the Python programming language) taught by a student for a couple of hours weekly in a classroom environment with lots of assignments, discussion and activity.

Presentations and assignments coming soon!
